What do you understand by NoSQL databases? Is MongoDB a NoSQL database? explain.
At the present time, the internet is loaded with big data, big users, big complexity etc. and also becoming more complex day by day. NoSQL is answer of all these problems, It is not a traditional database management system, not even a relational database management system (RDBMS). NoSQL stands for "Not Only SQL".
