How is the testing of the 'protected' method done?
To test the protected method, the test class is declared in the same package as the target class.

How is the testing of 'private' method done?
There is no direct way for testing of the private method; hence manual testing is to be performed, or the method is changed to "protected" method.


If the JUnit method's return type is 'string', what will happen?
JUnit test methods are designed to return 'void'. So the execution will fail.

What are the methods in fixtures?
setup
tearDown


Mention what are parameterized tests?

Parameterized tests enable developer to perform the same test over and again using different values.

Explain how you can write a simple JUnit test case?

Determine a subclass of TestCase
To initialize object(s) under test, override the setup() method
To release object(s) under test override the teardown() method
Determine one or more public test XYZ() methods that exercise the objects under test and assert expected results.
